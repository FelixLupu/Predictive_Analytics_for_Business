Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree - Udacity

This Nanodegree program prepares you for a career in predictive analytics, and enables you to master a scientific approach to solving problems with data. You’ll build fluency in two leading software packages: Alteryx, a tool that enables you to prepare, blend, and analyze data quickly; and Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. Over the course of the program, you’ll learn to:

• Create mental models to clearly define business issues
• Visualize and prepare data to improve efficacy of predictive models
• Identify and implement a variety of predictive modeling techniques


Course 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics

In this course, we give you a framework to help you organize and plan your analytical approach. We also introduce both simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.

Project: A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. You will apply a framework to work through the problem and build a linear regression model to provide results and a recommendation.


Course 2: Data Wrangling

Data Wrangling is at the core of all data activity. In this course you learn how to work with different data types, dirty data, and outliers. You will also learn how to reformat data and join data from different sources together.

Project: A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. You will use data preparation techniques to build a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.


Course 3: Classification Models

Classification models are a powerful tool for business analyst. In this course, you learn more about binary and non-binary classification models and how to use them to drive business insights.

Project: A bank recently received an influx of loan applications. You will build and apply a classification model to provide a recommendation on which loan applicants the bank should lend to.


Course 4: A/B Testing

Helping businesses make the best decisions is an essential part of Business Analysis. Planning and executing the analysis of an AB test allow you to provide confident recommendations. In this course, you learn how to create, execute, and analyze an AB test.

Project: A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. You will design and analyze an A/B test and write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.


Course 5: Time Series Forecasting

Time Series Forecasting is a powerful analytical tool. In this course, you learn how ETS and ARIMA models are used to forecast data and how they deal with trends and seasonality. These skills will be evaluated in the final project.

Project: A video game producer is planning production levels. You will use time series forecasting models to forecast monthly demand and provide a recommendation to help match supply to demand.


Course 6: Segmentation and Clustering

Segmentation and Clustering are effective methods for finding patterns in your data. In this course, you learn how to prepare data to be clustered appropriately and interpret results.

Project: A grocery store chain is planning a significant expansion. You will use multiple analytical techniques to provide recommendations on how to expand. After completing the project, you will feel comfortable combining predictive techniques and delivering results to complex business problems.
